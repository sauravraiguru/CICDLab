# Continuous Integration | Continuous Delivery - Workshop Lab
Creating a CI/CD Pipeline for deployment to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Cluster using Continuous Delivery Service.

### Overview

In this lab you will be connecting your Git repository having a sample NodeJs application to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline using Continuous Delivery service that will deploy to a IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster.

### Setup a Continuous Delivery Service

As a prerequisite we require a Continuous Delivery service on IBM Cloud, to create & run the pipeline
Note: Please check and note the region of your Kubernetes cluster, as we need to create a delivery pipeline

1. Lets go to [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) and search for ```Continuous Delivery``` OR directly go to [Continuous Delivery Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery)
2. [Select the region and create the service](img/cd-create.PNG) Optionally, you can add any tag if required.
